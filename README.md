## BMI Calculator App

Welcome to one of my first apps made during my Flutter learning journey!

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator app made using **Flutter SDK** and **Dart** Programming Language.

The input **(Height and Weight)** is given by the user and BMI is then calculated,

using the formula - **weight / (height * height)**
